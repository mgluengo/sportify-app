## Concept

> :point_right: [Find here the full project presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/mgluengo/sportify-app)

</br>

Sportify is the ultimate app for sports lovers!  

The app **finds venues for specific sports** wherever you are, keeps you up to date with the latest **sports events** in your area, and suggests the perfect **playlists from Spotify**, so you can give it all while you work out! :running_woman: :notes:

## Challenge

- Context: 3rd project for the **Data Analytics Bootcamp** at Ironhack (April 2022). 

- Goal: put our knowledge of **APIs** and **web scraping** into practice. 

- Time: during the bootcamp we worked in **hackathon** mode, so the full project (ideation, design, development, and final pitch) was completed in **3 afternoons**.

## How it works (user flow)

Based on the user's location and the selected workout, Sportify:
1. Shows  sports venues nearby to practice the sport they choose.
2. Show the events happening near them sorted by date.
3. Suggests lists from Spotify to play while they work out.
